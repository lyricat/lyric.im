[MobileCoin](https://www.mobilecoin.com/) is a cryptocurrency designed for digital cash on mobile devices. It’s easy to use with near instantaneous transactions.

On their website, the team MobileCoin said they hold a wealth of expertise in cryptography, mobile, and telecom, with the founder of signal as an advisor. They also said they’re focusing on users and their privacy.

I think the guys of MOB have kept their words. At the beginning of April, famous privacy messaging app, [Signal adds a payment feature](https://www.wired.com/story/signal-mobilecoin-payments-messaging-cryptocurrency/), which supports MobileCoin as the primary transfer asset.

If you don’t keep MOB yet, you may want some. Today, I’d introduce easiest 3 ways to buy MobileCoin.

## #1 Buy MOB at 4swap

[4swap.org](https://www.4swap.org) is a swap AMM protocol implement on Mixin Network, which is a place you can swap dozens of cryptocurrencies into MOB in seconds.

To use 4swap is simple. At first you need to install Fennec on your Firefox or Chrome browser. Fennec is browser based wallet like Metamask on ethereum. If you are familiar with Metamask, you will like Fennec.

You can fetch Fennec at [Chrome Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fennec/eincngenkhohbbfpkohipekcmnkfamjp) and [Firefox Addons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/fox_fennec/), you can also get the source code at [Github](https://github.com/fox-one/fennec).

The first time launching Fennec you need to import an existed keystore or create a new one. Please follow the instructions at Fennec's guide page to create an account and **backup its keystore file in safety (very important)**

You will be asked for a password to protect your keystore in Fennec, choose a strong password please.

### Transfer coins to Fennec

Fennec is a wallet on Mixin Network, which is a cross-chain public chain. Because of that, Fennec supports dozens of mainstream cryptocurrencies.

Open Fennec, and click "add default assets" button, you will get a default list of unique assets. You can also click the plus button to add any asset you like in the list.

- Click "Receive" button and select an asset you'd like to deposit, let's say BTC, you will get an address of Bitcoin.
- Use this address to transfer Bitcoin from your exchange or your BTC wallets to Fennec.

It may cost 10~30 minutes to receive the Bitcoin, according to traffic condition of the Bitcoin Network. Please be patient and have a cup of coffee.

### Trade at 4swap

Actually, you can buy any supported assets at 4swap, but this time, we will focus on MOB.

- Visit [the swap entry](https://app.4swap.org/#/swap?input=c6d0c728-2624-429b-8e0d-d9d19b6592fa&output=eea900a8-b327-488c-8d8d-1428702fe240), Click "Connect Wallet" button and click "Connect Fennec" button on the popup sheet.
- Fennec will popup a dialog to ask you to confirm the authorization, please click "Allow".
- Now 4swap has connected with Fennec.
- At the swap page, select the assets you want to swap to MOB, and fill the amount. 4swap will calculate how much you will get from the swapping and show you the predication result.
- Click "Swap" button to invoke the swapping.
- Click "Pay" button at the popup dialog and type the password to confirm.
- You will see the result in seconds to minutes (according to the network traffic) and get the MOB in your wallet.
